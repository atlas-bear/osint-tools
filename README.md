# Maritime and Supply Chain OSINT Tools

Atlas|Bear Labs has created this repository to share some of the tools we use in our own research. We hope they will be useful for others conducting maritime and supply chain research. This list includes various applications, sites, and tools that are currently working and available for tracking ships, containers, cargo movements, and more.

We encourage others to contribute, share, and update the list. We will also update the list as needed to ensure it remains a valuable resource for the community.

Feel free to explore the tools and provide feedback or suggestions for additional resources.
